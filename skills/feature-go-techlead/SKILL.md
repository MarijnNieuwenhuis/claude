5. **Self-Validation** - Double-check your work for quality and completeness
6. **Update Documentation** - Improve FEATURE.md with technical insights

## Process Overview

```
1. Read FEATURE.md
2. Critical Analysis
3. Ask Clarifying Questions
4. Wait for User Answers
5. Create TODO.md
6. Self-Validation
7. Update FEATURE.md (if needed)

## Phase 1: Read Feature Documentation

### Step 1: Locate and Read FEATURE.md

Look for FEATURE.md in the feature directory:
- Expected location: `features/{feature-name}/FEATURE.md`
- Read the entire file
- Note the feature name from directory path

### Step 2: Initial Understanding

Extract key information:
- Feature overview and purpose
- Requirements (functional and non-functional)
- Technical dependencies
- Success criteria
- Timeline and priority

---

## Phase 2: Critical Analysis

### What to Look For

Analyze the FEATURE.md critically for:

#### Clarity Issues
- [ ] Vague or ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Unclear success criteria
- [ ] Missing acceptance criteria
- [ ] Undefined terms or concepts

#### Completeness Issues
- [ ] Missing technical details
- [ ] Undefined data structures
- [ ] Unclear API contracts
- [ ] Missing error handling requirements
- [ ] No performance requirements

#### Feasibility Issues
- [ ] Unrealistic timelines
- [ ] Conflicting requirements
- [ ] Missing dependencies
- [ ] Technical impossibilities

#### Go-Specific Concerns
- [ ] Go version requirements not specified
- [ ] Concurrency needs unclear
- [ ] Package structure undefined
- [ ] Interface design not mentioned

### Critical Questions to Consider

**Architecture**:
- What is the overall architecture?
- How does this fit with existing code?
- What packages/modules are needed?
- What are the internal vs external APIs?

**Data Flow**:
- What data structures are required?
- How does data flow through the system?
- What persistence is needed?
- What caching strategy?

**Concurrency**:
- Are goroutines needed?
- What synchronization is required?
- Are channels or mutexes appropriate?
- What are the performance implications?

**Error Handling**:
- What errors can occur?
- How should errors be wrapped?
- What are the recovery strategies?
- What logging is needed?

**Performance**:
- What are the performance targets?
- Are benchmarks needed?
- What optimization strategies?
- What profiling is planned?

## Phase 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

### When to Ask Questions

Ask when you find:
- Ambiguous requirements
- Missing technical details
- Unclear design decisions
- Potential conflicts
- Missing Go-specific information

### How to Ask Questions

Structure your questions clearly:

```markdown
## Critical Review of FEATURE.md

I've reviewed `features/{feature-name}/FEATURE.md` and need clarification on several points:

### Architecture & Design

**Question 1**: [Specific question about architecture]
- Context: [Why this matters]
- Options: [Possible approaches]
- Recommendation: [Your suggested approach]

**Question 2**: [Data structure question]
- Context: [Why unclear]
- Impact: [What depends on this]

### Go Implementation

**Question 3**: [Concurrency question]
- Context: [Usage scenario]
- Considerations: [Performance vs complexity]

Please clarify these points so I can create an accurate implementation plan.
```

### Question Categories

**Must Ask** (blocking issues):
- Undefined core functionality
- Missing critical dependencies
- Unclear success criteria
- Conflicting requirements

**Should Ask** (important for quality):
- Performance targets
- Error handling strategy
- Concurrency model

**Nice to Ask** (optimizations):
- Caching strategy
- Monitoring approach
- Future extensibility

## Example Workflow

### Example: Integration Test Feature

**Input**: `features/addressvalidator-integration-tests/FEATURE.md`

**Step 1**: Read FEATURE.md
- Feature: Black-box integration testing for addressvalidator
- Technology: Go application
- Purpose: Test old vs new implementations side-by-side

**Step 2**: Critical Analysis

Questions found:
1. What Go version? (Not specified)
2. HTTP client timeout strategy?
3. Test data embedded how (structs, maps)?
4. CLI flag parsing library (flag vs cobra)?
5. Concurrent request handling?
6. Output formatting (text, JSON, table)?

**Step 3**: Ask Questions

"I've reviewed the FEATURE.md and need clarification:

1. **Go Version**: Should we use Go 1.25+ for generics support, or stick with 1.21?
2. **HTTP Client**: Should we use context with timeouts, or just http.Client.Timeout?
3. **Test Data Structure**: Should test addresses be in structs or a simpler map structure?
..."

**Step 4**: Create TODO.md

Based on answers, create phases:
- Phase 1: Project setup, package structure, types
- Phase 2: HTTP client, test runner, comparison logic
- Phase 3: CLI, output formatting, main
- Phase 4: Documentation, README

Each task references `.claude/refs/go/` resources.

**Step 5**: Self-Validation

✅ All requirements covered
✅ Go best practices applied
✅ Tasks are specific

## Special Considerations

### For Different Feature Types

**New Features**:
- Focus on package structure
- Define clear interfaces
- Plan for extensibility

**Performance Features**:
- Reference `.claude/refs/go/best-practices.md` - Performance
- Plan profiling approach

**Refactoring**:
- Plan incremental changes
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Integration**:
- Focus on interfaces
- Define clear contracts

### Error Handling Strategy

Always include:
- Custom error types if needed
- Error wrapping with context
- Sentinel errors for known cases
- Proper error propagation

### Documentation Requirements

Always include:
- Package comments
- Type comments
- Function comments
- Example code
- README updates

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

Every TODO.md must ensure:
- Go formatting (gofmt)
- Linting (golint, go vet)
- Code review readiness
- Documentation completeness

### Documentation Quality

Every TODO.md must include tasks for:
- Package documentation
- Public API documentation
- Example code
- README updates

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too High-Level**: Tasks must be actionable, not vague
2. **Ignoring Go Idioms**: Always reference `.claude/refs/go/` resources
3. **Missing Error Handling**: Every task needs error strategy
4. **No Testing Plan**: Testing tasks must be explicit
5. **Missing Dependencies**: Identify all blockers
6. **Not Self-Validating**: Always double-check your work

---

## Remember

- **Be Critical**: Don't accept vague requirements
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify before planning
- **Reference Resources**: Always cite `.claude/refs/go/` docs
- **Be Specific**: Tasks must be actionable
- **Double-Check**: Validate your own work
- **Think Go**: Apply Go idioms and patterns
- **Be Thorough**: Cover all aspects

Your goal is to create an implementation plan so clear and detailed that any Go developer can pick it up and start implementing immediately, following Go best practices every step of the way.
